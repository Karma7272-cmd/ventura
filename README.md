Micro credit application
Overview:
1. The application helps “Salaried persons” to apply and get approved for micro loans automatically
using Artificial Intelligence.
2. The app lets any Salaried person register for an account with their email address and mobile
number.
3. Once registered, he will be asked to fill a number of details:
1. Full Name
2. Address
3. PAN Number
4. Company where he his employed
5. Current salary
6. Previous salary
7. Owns a house?
8. If rented, what is the rent amount
9. Approximate grocery expense per month
10.Current EMIs
11.Date of previous hike
12.Estimated date of next hike
13.Name of his bank
4. And more…. (Details are not given intentionally because you need to think of all the data points
required for this requirement and capture those details from the applicant. Example: You can ask
“how frequent you visit the malls in a month”... If the applicant with a salary of 20k per month
says, 4, that means he goes there every month 4 times and his average spending in the mall
alone is around 2000 to 4000. If we grant a loan of 100000, and if his repayment period is 12
months, the probability of his repayment is very unlikely. )
5. Once the details are captured, the person should be able to apply for the loan. Once the
customer applies for a loan, the app will review his details, analyze it and run its algorithm to
determine:
6. - Is the person eligible for a loan ? or should be rejected
7. - If yes, how much loan amount can be granted?
8. - What could be the repayment period and EMI?
9. - Risk score
10. These results should be displayed to the customer after he submits his loan request.
11. The app should have a “well written algorithm” to analyze the details of the customer, check
similar loan requests from customers with similar profiles, analyze the spending habits,
determine the eligibility based on various criteria and more.
12. NOTE: A well-written, thoughtful, creative algorithm will be given weightage. And You should
be able to explain the logic behind your algorithm, recommendation / prediction engine during
the interview
